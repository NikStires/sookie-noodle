      <h1>Noodle</h1>
      <p>
        Noodle was born on April 24th 2021, he is full of energy and loves to
        play. His favorite place to hang out is on top of the refrigerator, even
        though he isn't allowed up there. Currently Noodle is leash training so
        he can go on walks and expend some of that energy.
